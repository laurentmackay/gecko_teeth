Oscillatory dynamics are ubiquitous in biology and serve many purposes ranging

 Here we define an oscillator as a single unit containing all the necessary
 interactions to produce cyclic dynamics, and note that many interesting
 and non-trivial dynamics arise when considering systems of interacting
 oscillators.
 Entrainment of oscillators, defined as a state of fixed phase differences,
 is a common mechanism for producing the robust synchronization and spatiotempor
al order in networks of biological oscillators

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The problem of entrainment has been studied extensively using both experimental
 and theoretical approaches.
 Of primary interest are (i) the existence of entrained states for a given
 system, (ii) precise descriptions of entrained states (e.g., whether all
 oscillators are synchronized in-phase versus anti-phase synchronization
 where a subset is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 out-of-phase with the rest), and (iii) the conditions required for attaining
 an entrained state.
 On the theoretical side, the simplest oscillator model uses a single variable
 to for phase (phase oscillators), with phase progressing at a fixed phase
 velocity.
 Entrainment is studied by considering a collection of oscillators with
 appropriate coupling terms that depend on instantaneous phase-differences
 and modulate the phase velocity of each oscillator (Kuramoto model).
 Generically, in-phase synchronization occurs when coupling is attractive
 and sufficiently strong to overcome any intrinsic phase velocity differences,
 whereas anti-phase synchronization via repulsive coupling terms requires
 more stringent restrictions on the the oscillator network (i.e., low number
 of oscillators and low connectivity)

On the phase dynamics of cyclic reptilian tooth replacement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
For over a century, scientists have studied the striking spatiotemporal
 patterns observed during the continual and cyclic replacement of teeth
 in many repitilian taxa

 From a physiological perspective, it is thought that continual tooth replacemen
t in reptiles serves to deliver progressively larger teeth as the jaw grows.
 Numerous features of tooth development are evolutionarily conserved from
 squamate reptiles and crocodilians to mammals

 Thus, it has been proposed that the

 of tooth replacement observed in these lower vertebrates may have relevance
 to the dynamics of mammalian tooth replacement

\begin_layout Standard
At the simplest descriptive level, replacement at given tooth position occurs
 with a roughly fixed period.
 However, data collected from fossil records and live animals reveals a
 more nuanced picture of replacment timing with subtly related features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is typically a phase difference of roughly one half replacement cycle
 between neighbouring teeth.
 This has the effect that the odd and even-numbered teeth appear to be replaced
 independently of one another, maintaining a relatively constant functional
 tooth density throughout time.
 Early theories even proposed that they are produced from physically distinct
 locations.
 Thus it is common in the literature to refer to the even and odd dentitions,
 which are said to be nearly in anti-phase at most times

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A closer examination of replacement timings shows that nearest neighbours
 are not in perfect anti-phase.
 Rather, next nearest neighbours are slightly out-of-phase, producing apparent
 replacement

waves

 progating through the even (or odd) dentition usually either front-to-back

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Data also suggests that there are systematic variations in the amount of
 time between tooth replacements.
 In both crocodiles and leopard geckos, the replacement period at a given
 tooth position increases from front-to-back, with crocodiles exhibiting
 a much larger gradient (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim100\%$

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Furthermore, the rate of tooth replacement also decreases with the age
 of an animal 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Edmund proposed the influential graphical theory of replacement waves as
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Zahnreihen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or rows of teeth, that propagate through the odd/even dentitions due to
 a diffusing stimulus that somehow only activates tooth production in alternatel
y numbered teeth 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Edmund1960,Edmund1962"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In turn, Osborn later mathematically formalized this graphical theory and
 compared the equations to experimental findings 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Osborn1971,Osborn1974"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, arriving at an alternative geometric theory based on a mechanistic hypothesis.
 Namely, Osborn postulated that the half-cycle phase shift between nearest
 neighbours were the results of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spheres of inhibition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 surrounding each developing tooth and suggested that the directionality
 of replacement waves may be explained by differences in the replacement
 periods of different tooth families 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Osborn1971"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The newer geometric hypothesis posits that during the very early stages
 of its development in the dental lamina a tooth produces an inhibitory
 signal which diffuses outwards and inhibits the development of neighbouring
 sites.
 Then as a nascent tooth ages and migrates towards the oral cavity, its
 sphere of inhibition both shrinks and shifts spatially until the neighbouring
 sites are no longer contained in the sphere and can thus produce their
 own teeth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies across a plethora of model organisms have elucidated some of the
 morphological changes and biochemical interactions involved in tooth replacemen
t, giving insight into how and when spheres of inhibition might arise as
 well as their relation to tooth replacement

 These studies show that the cellular material required for a tooth originates
 from spatially organized pools of epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells
 near the tip of the dental lamina

 Many of the steps of tooth replacement depend on Wnt/β-catenin signalling
 pathway, an ancient intercellular signalling pathway that potently induces
 spatially patterned cell fates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Liu2010,Loh2016"

 Interestingly, interactions between the BMP (bone morphogenetic protein)
 and Wnt signalling pathways in stem cells at the dental lamina tip are
 known to form a self-activating circuit 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

, suggesting that spme downstream effects of Wnt-signalling will proceed
 autonomously once the appropriate cell populations are in place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tooth initiation begins by Wnt-driven activation of mesenchymal and eptitheleal
 cells to produce the tooth bud and a surrounding dental follicle.

 Wnt-signalling at tooth sites is cyclic and when it is active at one tooth
 site then its neighbouring sites exist in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 state with no Wnt/

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Migration of the nascent tooth towards the oral cavity would conceivably
 decrease the inhibition at neighbouring sites, allowing the previsouly
 paused neighbours to eventually become active.
 The precise molecular mechanism behind the cyclic activity and spatially
 extended inhibiton of Wnt remains unknown.
 However, many Wnt inhibitors are known to play prominent roles in tooth
 replacement (e.g., Fgf4, Bmp2, and Shh

LatexCommand cite
key "Kettunen2000,Smith2009,Cho2011,Navarro2018,Thiery2022"

); also, other relevant interaction partners are known to induce intrinsically
 oscillatory dyanmics in Wnt activity (e.g., axin2 and APC 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lammi2004,Cavallo2020,MacDonald2009,Thakker1995"

\end_inset

 In summary, Wnt-signalling may underlie the cyclic nature of tooth replacement
 (through its effects driving tooth initiation and migration), and spatially-ext
ended inhibitory interactions may explain the spatiotemporal coordination
 between neighbouring tooth sites.

 Many aspects of the spatiotemporal patterning of both mamalian hair follicles
 and bird plummage can be recapitulated using Reaction-Diffusion (RD) models
 based on the Turing mechanism, and it has been noted that dental development

 These models give particularly good insight into the spatial appearance
 of tooth families during embryonic growth, as Turing patterns exhibit a
 (roughly) constant spacing and new tooth families are added as the jaw
 grows enough to add in one more spacing

 On the other hand, those studies have not considered the long-term behaviour
 predicted by RD models.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a simplification to full spatiotemporal Turing RD modelling, the geometric
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

sphere of inhibition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hypothesis was implemented as a mathematical model in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Brink2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and its long-term behaviour was analyzed.
 As expected, such a model robustly produces the roughly half-cycle phase
 difference between odd and even numbered teeth.
 However, it struggles to produce long-lived phase asymmetry (i.e., directional
 replacement waves) and fails to capture the effects of certain surgical
 manipulations.
 In order to improve on these results, a novel model based on ordinary different
ial equations was proposed.
 This phase-inhibitor model treats each tooth as a phase oscillator that
 produces an inhibitory signal, slowing the phase progression of its neighbours.
 This variant of the hypothesis proposed by Osborn replaces the hard geometric
 threshold for tooth initiation with a more dynamic picture that takes into
 account the history of tooth eruptions at each site.
 Inspired by the dynamics of biochemical reactions, each tooth site in the
 phase-inhibitor model has a phase-dependent sensitivity for the inhibitory
 signal coming from its neighbours.
 The phase-inhibitor model succesfully predicts (i) anti-phase synchronization
 of nearest neighbours and (ii) stable directional replacement waves when
 spatial gradients in the period are imposed on the model.

, predicting and controlling such patterns remains a technically challening
 process.
 Rather, we propose a simpler strategy which is to assume that the geometry
 of tooth positions is likely set by some type of Turing mechanism, and
 that the temporal cycling through tooth initiation and migration stages
 is (mostly) downstream of whatever interactions dictate the spatial positions
 of tooth families.

The emergence of spatiotemporal order in networks of interacting oscillators

 Entrainment of oscillators, defined as a state of where all oscillators

 biological events (i.e., ensuring they occur with fixed phase differences)

 However, the common period of entrained states is logically at odds with
 the observation of spatial gradients in replacement periods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two major possibilities for reconciling the period gradients with
 dynamical systems theory: (i) the system may be tending towards an entrained
 state from some initial condition specified by an embryonic developmental
 program (i.e., the period gradient will eventually vanish), or (ii) the system
 has aperiodic stationary solutions such as qausi-periodic or even chaotic
 solutions with perpetual period gradients

In this paper, we study the problem of reptilian tooth replacement dynamics
 using mathematical models.
 We begin by studying the evolution of phases in a linear array of uncoupled
 oscillator, demonstrating how phase asymmetry and apparent replacement

 We then study oscillators coupled by mutual inhibition and establish conditions
 for the emergence of solutions with neighbours in near anti-phase and experimen

We use two related mathematical models to investigate oscillators coupled
 through lateral inhibition, focusing on the existence of (i) entrained
 states and (ii) aperiodic oscillatory solutions that arise in certain contexts
 (e.g., when intrinsic periods become too dissimilar).
 The first model is a phase-inhibitor ODE model similar to what was used

 the diffusion of inhibitor in the space between tooth sites.
 We study both models using a combination of time-integration to obtain
 periodic and aperiodic solutions, and numerical continuation to help define
 parameter regimes where specific types of solutions are relevant.

Summary Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are interested in quantitatively analyzing cyclic events such as tooth
 replacement or the evolution of model oscillators.
 Of primary interest to the phenomenon of tooth replacement are (i) the
 extent to which nearest neighbours are in the anti-phase (ii) the left-right
 phase asymmetry between a tooth site/oscillator and its neightbours.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To quantify these two aspects, we first denote the right and left relative
 phase of tooth replacement at the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{{\rm th}}$
\end_inset

 tooth site (normalized to 1) by 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{r}^{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{l}^{n}$
\end_inset

 , respectively.
 The time of a specific tooth replacement event at this site is denoted
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 For a given replacment event, the right and left relative phases are given
 by

Anti-Phase Metric
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anti-phase oscillations correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{r}^{n}=\phi_{l}^{n}=1/2$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, so we seek a metric which is near unity for and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{r},\phi_{l}\approx1/2$
\end_inset

 and drops off quickly to zero once either relative phase deviates significantly
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

.
 We propose the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi=\left(\sin\left(\pi\phi_{r}^{n}\right)\sin\left(\pi\phi_{l}^{n}\right)\right)^{3}
\]

\end_inset

where the third order dependence was determined subjectively from the criterion
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=0.3$
\end_inset

 acts as a threshold for configurations we perceived as anti-phase or not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to summarize the behaviour of a jaw with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2N_{0}+1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\psi}$

, given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{\psi}=\frac{1}{N-2}\sum_{n=-\left(N_{0}-1\right)}^{N_{0}-1}\psi_{i}.\label{eq:psi_bar}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Phase Asymmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to quantify phase asymmetry we first define a measure for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{{\rm th}}$
\end_inset

 oscillator 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{n}$
\end_inset

, given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi_{n}=\frac{\sin\left(\pi\left(\phi_{r}^{n}-\phi_{l}^{n}\right)\right)}{\pi}\label{eq:phase_asym}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{i}\approx\phi_{r}^{n}-\phi_{l}^{n}$
\end_inset

 in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{r}^{n}-\phi_{l}^{n}\to0$
\end_inset

.
 The choice of using a 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin$
\end_inset

 function was made to cases with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{r}^{n}\approx1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{l}^{n}\approx0$
\end_inset

 (or vice-versa) have a low asymmetry score, as in these scenarios phase
 asymmetry is less meaningful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can then define two measures for a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2N_{0}+1$
\end_inset

 tooth sites.
 Firstly, we define the mean phase asymmetry for the entire jaw, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\chi}$
\end_inset

, given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{\chi}=\frac{1}{N-2}\sum_{n=-\left(N_{0}-1\right)}^{N_{0}-1}\chi_{n}.\label{eq:chi_bar}

 In order to distinguish between apparent front-to-back and back-to-front

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\bar{\chi}=\bar{\chi}_{{\rm right}}-\bar{\chi}_{{\rm {\rm left}}}\label{eq:chi_hat}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\chi}_{{\rm left}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\chi}_{{\rm right}}$
\end_inset

 are the mean values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 in the left and right sides of the jaw, respectively.
 We note that, on the basis the data in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, we expect 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\chi>0$
\end_inset

 for leopard .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we note that from 1-3 years of age leopard geckos seem to exhibit
 tooth replacement with 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\psi}\approx0.8$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\bar{\chi}>0$
\end_inset

 (i.e., nearly anti-phase with apparent back-to-front waves).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Computational Zahnreihe Reconstruction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now seek a means to convert the phase asymmetries of replacement events
 with the the apparent replacement waves reported by Edmund and others.
 It has previously been shown that different 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directions are obtained by assuming different rules for the waves 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeMar1972,Osborn1974"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Given the doubts and uncertainties about the mechanisms underlying such
 rules, we seek a simple graphical rule that captures the most basic principle
 of Zahnreihe theory and systematically converts replacement times into
 local wave directions.
 A common approach is to draw line segments joining evenly-spaced tooth
 replacement events in a plot has time on the vertical axis and tooth index
 on the horizontal axis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Edmund1962,DeMar1972,Osborn1974"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 To avoid ambiguities in wave direction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeMar1972"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we draw line segments between alternately numbered teeth (i.e., next nearest
 neighbours).
 Our graphical rule should result in the line segments drawn through sequential
 tooth generations that are roughly parallel and equidistant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to draw these lines, we first compute the phase asymmetry of every
 replacement event.
 If a given replacement event and the next replacement event of its leftward
 (rightward) neighbour both have positive (negative) 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 then we draw a line between the two events.
 With appropriately timed replacement events this produces a sequence of
 replacement events joined by lines with a clear direction, which can be
 interpreted as a Zahnreihe (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:leopard_gecko_phases"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

a).
 To reduce the effect of missed/skipped replacement events, we futhermore
 add a rule that events within the same Zahnreihe must occur within a certain
 amount of time of one another (e.g., within two cycles of the middle tooth).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This data-driven approach was chosen due to being mechanistically agnostic
 and based entirely on objective measures such as phase asymmetry.
 We could conceivably have chosen the opposite rule of drawing rightward
 (leftward) waves for positive (negative) 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

; however, counter to the classic descriptions of Zhareinhe and our requirement
 to have well-separated and nearly parallel lines, such a rule tends to
 produce lines that appear to join nearest neighbours and/or exhibit many
 intersections.
 Moreover, from the limited data with unambiguous phase asymmetry presented
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Edmund1962"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, it seems that Edmund's approach to drawing Zahnreihe largely overlaps
 with our proposed rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on this rule for drawing Zahnreihe, replacement timing data with a
 fixed sign of phase asymmetry on each side of the jaw and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\bar{\chi}<0$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\bar{\chi}>0$
\end_inset

) is straightforwardly interpreted as apparent front-to-back (back-to-front)
 waves.
 We stress that, although we have produced a systematic rule for drawing
 apparent replacement waves, this is mearly a way to summarize data and
 that the presence of such apparent waves yields no insight into the mechanism
 behind tooth replacement dynamics.

Spatiotemporal pattern of tooth replace in Leopard geckos 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin by using applying our computational zahnreihe reconstruction method
 to tooth replacement data collected from leopard geckos.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Brink2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 it was shown that leopard geckos tooth replacement occurs with a positive
 (negative) phase asymmetry on the right (left) side of the jaw.
 According to logic of our proposed zahnreihe reconstruction technique,
 this corresponds to back-to-front waves.
 To illustrate this we use a dataset published 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Brink2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, where tooth replacement events were recorded across the whole leopard
 gecko jaw over a period of 259 days with most teeth exhibiting around seven
 replacement events.
 Our compuational zahnreihe reconstruction method was applied to this data
 (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:leopard_gecko_phases"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

a), showing very clear back-to-front waves as expected.
 We also confirmed that these tooth replacement events are very close to
 anti-phase by computing the anti-phase metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 for each event, with most events exhibiting 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\approx0.8$
\end_inset

 (see lower part of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

a).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the timing of replacement events, we can compute the replacement period
 at each tooth site.
 After discarding events from tooth positions 8-22 due to surgery-related
 artefacts, two distinct trends in replacement period are observed in the
 data.
 Firstly, over time the replacement period slows down, which can be seen
 by comparing the averaged replacement period (in days) at each toothsite
 during the first 3 cycles of replacement with the replacment periods from
 the fourth cycle onwards (compared red and black data in left side of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:leopard_gecko_phases"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

c).
 Secondly, it seems that the replacement period increases from the front
 to the rear of the jaw (compare tooth position 0 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm36$
\end_inset

 in left side Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:leopard_gecko_phases"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

c).
 To quantify these trends, we use a simple model for the period of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{{\rm th}}$
\end_inset

 tooth at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, given by 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T\left(i,t\right)=T_{{\rm 0}}\left(t\right)+\Delta T(t)\left|i/N_{0}\right|\label{eq:period_data_model}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the period of the middle tooth, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

 is the magnitude of the period gradient, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{0}=36$
\end_inset

.
 Fitting this model to the early data (cycle #
\begin_inset Formula $\leq$
\end_inset

3) we estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}=34.36\pm0.47$
\end_inset

 days and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T=3.18\pm0.82$
\end_inset

 days, while for the latter data (cycle #
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

4) we find 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}=39.83\pm0.42$
\end_inset

 days and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T=2.43\pm0.71$
\end_inset

 days.
 Thus it is clear that the replacement period of all teeth increases over
 time and that there is a nonzero spatial gradient in the period across
 the jaw.
 To acheive a finer time resolution, we defined sliding windows of 150 days
 (roughly 4 replacment cycles) and fit Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:period_data_model"
plural "false"

 to the data in these sliding windows (see right side of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:leopard_gecko_phases"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

b).
 This analysis corroborates the analyis of the early and late replacment
 data, showing a continuous and nearly linear increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}$
\end_inset

 and a 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

 that seems to be fluctuating around a constant value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back-to-front waves are nearly ubiquitous in reptiles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Moreover, a gradual lengthening of the replacement period as well as spatial
 gradients in the period that increase from the front of the jaw to the
 rear have also been reported in crocodiles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Edmund1962,Westergaard1987"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A global slowing of tooth replacement is unlikely to have a signifcant
 effect on apparent replacement waves aside from slowing their progression
 through the jaw.
 On the other hand, the effects of a spatial gradient in replacement period
 is more difficult to predict.
 Thus we next investigate the influence of period gradients on different
 spatiotemporal patterns of tooth replacement.
 We begin by modelling toothsites as simple non-interacting oscillators
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Dynamics-of-chi"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, showing that these gradients can spontaneously induce apparent waves from
 anti-phase and in-phase initial conditions.
 Then in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:ODE-Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we incorporate mutual inhibitory interactions via an ODE model, and find
 that such interactions can lead to stable entrained states exhbiting apparent
 replacement waves.

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{n}\in\left[0,1\right)$
\end_inset

 is the initial normalised phase difference (i.e., at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

).
 We are interested in the phase asymmetry of the next replacement at tooth
 site 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, as detailed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Phase-Asymmetry-Flipping"

\end_inset

 this is determined by the right and left relative initial phases, i.e, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta_{r}^{n}=\delta^{n}-\delta^{n+1}\quad\text{and}\quad\delta_{l}^{n}=\delta^{n}-\delta^{n-1},
\]

\end_inset

respectively, as well as the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{0}/\gamma$
\end_inset

 (see Eqs.

 For physiologically reasonable conditions (
\begin_inset Formula $0<\gamma<N_{0}/2$
\end_inset

), with anti-phase intial conditions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{l}^{n}=\delta_{r}^{n}=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, this invariably predicts positive phase asymmetry on the left side of
 the jaw and negative asymmetry on the left (i.e., apparent front-to-back
 replacement waves), while with in-phase intial conditions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{l}^{n}=\delta_{r}^{n}=0$
\end_inset

, we find instead apparent back-to-front replacement waves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phase asymmetry eventually switches sign repeatedly.
 For the class of initial conditions with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{n+1}-\delta_{n-1}$
\end_inset

 independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 (or possibly fixed on each side of the jaw), it can be shown that phase
 asymmtery switching begins at the midjaw and spread outwards.
 This switching phenomenon initiates at the tooth site 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\pm1$
\end_inset

 at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\tilde{t}_{1}$
\end_inset

, where, in general, the 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{\text{th}}$
\end_inset

 phase asymmetry sign flip occurs at a time given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{t}_{k}=T_{0}\left(k+\text{sgn}(n)\left(\delta^{n+1}-\delta^{n-1}\right)\right)\left(1+N_{0}/(2\gamma)\right).\label{eq:first_flipping_time}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It then takes a some time, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{k}$
\end_inset

, for this sign flipping to propagate to all the way to the the back of
 the jaw, given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{k}=T_{0}\left(k+\text{sgn}(n)\left(\delta^{n+1}-\delta^{n-1}\right)\right)\left(1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)\left(N_{0}-1\right).\label{eq:propagation_time}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For cases with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{n+1}=\delta^{n-1}$
\end_inset

 (e.g., anti-phase or in-phase intial conditions) this predicts an instantaneous
 switch (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{1}=0$
\end_inset

) at 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{t}_{1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 For anti-phase initial conditions, we observe exactly the directional switching
 described by Edmund, that is back-to-front waves for 
\begin_inset Formula $t<0$
\end_inset

 and front-to-back waves for 
\begin_inset Formula $t>0$
\end_inset

 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On longer timescales, the inital phase asymmtery gets erased and is replaced
 by complicated spatial patterns.
 To investigate this in physiologically-relevant manner, we choose parameters
 that roughly correspond to the lower jaws of crocodiles (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{0}=21,\gamma=1.0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

) and leopard geckos (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{0}=45,\gamma=0.1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Brink2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 For the model crocodile jaw, we observe a switch in apparent replacement
 wave direction starting at 11.5 replacement cycles (approximately 8.86 years)
 taking some 31.5 replacement cycles (approximately 22.5 years) to reach the
 rear of the jaw.
 The combination of a long propagation time and comparatively shorter first
 flipping time leads to the rapid development of a complicated spatiotemporal
 pattern of replacement wave directionality (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig: phase_row_uncoupled"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

b).
 On the other hand, for the model gecko jaw the first switch happens much
 later after 226 replacement cycles (approximately 18.8 years) and only takes
 47.5 replacement cycles (approximately 4 years) to spread through the jaw
 (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig: phase_row_uncoupled"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

c).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From these simple simulations we gain a number of insights.
 Firstly, we find that apparent directional replacement waves develop spontaneou
sly from any initial condition provided there is a gradient in replacement
 periods, no interaction between tooth sites is required.
 Moreover, with an appropriate set of intial conditions we observe the abrupt
 switching in apparent replacement wave direction reported by Edmund in
 crocodiles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Edmund1962"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, no stimulus source is required.
 Secondly, after such directional switching occurs, we eventually see a
 breakdown of clear front-to-back replacement waves as has been described
 in mature crocodiles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Edmund1962"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, for parameters based on the leopard gecko jaw, we observe apparent
 replacment waves maintaining their directionality for timescales longer
 than the typical lifespan of an animal.
 However, the back-to-front waves in this simple model gecko jaw arise from
 in-phase initial conditions.
 With such an approach only brief period of time actually exhibits waves
 with both the correct directionality and neighbouring teeth close to anti-phase
 (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\bar{\chi}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\psi}>0.5$
\end_inset

, see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Initial-phase-asymmetry"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

b-d).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, while apparent replacement waves seem to be an emergent property of
 a row oscillators with a spatial gradient in period, the choice of initial
 condition determines the initial directionality of the waves.
 Moreover, without some type of interaction between oscillators the directionali
ty cannot be maintained indefinitely.
 We now consider models with inhibitory coupling between oscillators (i.e.,
 Eqs.

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

) to see if such interactions can (i) serve as a robust means of obtaining
 waves with a specific directionality and (ii) maintain that directionality
 for longer, or potentially indefinite, periods of time.

 We begin by setting

 (i.e., assuming identical tooth sites) so that we can define coupling regimes,
 and then we vary the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 within physiologically-relevant ranges.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$

 conditions and then integrating in time until a stationary solution is

 The solutions are continued numerically to find the parameter ranges for
 the existence of entrained states, and then numerical time-integration
 is used to study solutions beyond the regions of entrainment.

As 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\to1$
\end_inset

 we begin to see a secondary maximum appear in our solutions.
 This should correspond to period doubling , but I have not been able to
 actually detect a period doubling bifurcation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$

 increases, we first observe the appearance of spatially patterned oscillations
 where every other tooth exhibits period doubled small amplitude oscilaltions
 near some phase close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$

 while its neighbours complete full phase cycles (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

b, and ).
 As we increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$

 more, we also find solutions with apparent unidirectional replacment waves,
 sweeping across the whole jaw either leftwards or rightwards (see Fig.

 Increasing

 further, we also find 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

wavelets
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 that appear as subtle back-to-front waves for small 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 Finally with even larger values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$

, the effects of inhibition are strong enough for all the oscillators to
 arrest one another in spatially patterened equilibria, with the number
 of possible equilibria grows significantly with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

\begin_layout Standard
We continue all of these solutions in the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=9$
\end_inset

, allowing us to detect the parameter regimes where the solutions exist
 and are stable.
 Notably, we find that the family of simple anti-phase undergoes a series
 of bifurcations that gives rise to the unirectional waves and the wavelet
 solutions, while the family of spatially-patterned oscillations is isolated
 from all the branches emerging from the anti-phase oscillations (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

e).
 For large enough values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 these different periodic solutions collide with equilibria and cease to
 exist.
 This allows us to define three coupling regimes: weakly couple, strongly
 coupled, and oscillator death (see Fig.

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the family of simple anti-phase oscillations is stable for
 arbitrily small 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$

 and exhibits two pitchfork of periodics bifurcations as 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$

 increases (see cyan line in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

e).
 The first at 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\approx5.82$
\end_inset

, results in a loss of stability and produces two branches corresponding
 to leftward or rightward replacement waves (see purple and green lines
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

e, respectively); these branches are then both annihilated through a pair
 of saddle node of periodics bifurcations.
 The second pitchfork, at 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\approx6.3$
\end_inset

, is subcritical with one of the two unstable emerging branches subsequently
 gaining stability through a pitchfork of periodics bifurcation with the
 two families of periodic solution that annihilate with the unidirectional
 waves, resulting in a stable branch corresponding to the wavelet solutions
 (see teal line in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

e).
 The branch of stable wavelets loses stability trough a period doubling
 cascade at 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\approx6.8$
\end_inset

 (for simplicity only the first period doubling is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

e); both branches, along with the branch of simple anti-phase solutions,
 then terminate through heteroclynic bifurcations at 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=8$

 (see HT4 and HT5 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Meanwhile, the family of spatially-patterned oscillations becomes stable
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=4$
\end_inset

 through a pitchfork of periodics bifurcation and also terminates at heteroclyni
c bifrucations at 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\approx2.02$

 Finally, the families of equilibria are born out of two saddle-node bifurcation
s at 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\approx8$
\end_inset

, with one of the families gaining stability through a pithfork bifurcation
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\approx8.74$

w).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the weakly coupled regime (anti-phase solutions only) is 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\epsilon<4$
\end_inset

, the strongly coupled regime (coexistence of anti-phase solutions, spatially-pa
tterned oscillations, unidirectional replacement waves, and wavelets) is
 roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $4<\epsilon<10.84$
\end_inset

, and the oscillator death regime is roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>10.84$
\end_inset

.
 We note that there are more families of periodic solutions and equilibria
 that are possible for larger 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, but that these are primarily minor variations of the solutions types already
 discussed.
 Thus, in all three of these regimes with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0$
\end_inset

, we have not detected any entrained states with bilaterally symmetric waves
 that could conceivably correspond to either front-to-back or back-to-front
 waves.

 The bifurcations discussed in the text are labelled by a short black line
 and a text label (HT=heteroclinic, PFP=pitchfork of periodics, SN=saddle-node
 of equilibria, PF=pitchfork of equilibria).
 The projection used was chosen to separate the various oscillations (coloured
 lines) and equilibria (black lines), with stable solutions appearing as
 solid line while unstable solutions appear as dotted (unstable oscillations)
 or dashed (unstable equilibria) lines.
 Dark blue lines represents spatially patterned oscillation which are born
 as unstable oscillations out of HT1, and gain stability through PFP1 which
 produces two more unstable spatially patterned oscillations.
 Cyan lines represents simple anti-phase solutions, which loses stability
 at PFP2; producing solutions corresponding to leftward and rightward replacemen
t waves, represented by purple and green lines, repsectively.
 All of the solution branches connected to the simple anti-phase solutions
 terminate at 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\approx8$
\end_inset

 through HT2 or HT5.

\begin_layout Standard
Out of the three coupling regimes identified for

\end_inset

, only the weakly and strongly coupled regimes contain oscillatory solutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the anti-phase solutions found in the the weekly coupled regime, we
 find that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 breaks the phase symmetry of oscillations.
 For small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 this occurs with perfect bilaterally symmetry, producing leftward (rightward)
 waves on the right (left) side of the jaw that converge on the middle tooth,
 resulting in apparent front-to-back replacement waves (i.e., periodic solutions
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\bar{\chi}$

 Increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 further, we generically observe a breakdown of the bilateral symmetry,
 resulting in front-to-back waves that are shifted away from the jaw midline
 (see orange lines in top panel of Fig.

Meanwhile, in the strongly coupled regime, for small values of

 we observe that mean

\end_inset

c).
 Increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 further, we observe that the fixed sign of phase asymmetry breaks down
 at the rear of the jaw on one side, resulting once again in solutions that
 appear as front-to-back waves shifted away from the middle oscillator (see
 see pink lines in bottom panel of Fig.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generically, if we increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 sufficiently there is eventually a breakdown of entrainment; in this case
 the oscillators exhibit a gradient of incommesurable periods even after
 arbitrary long waiting periods.
 While there are large variety of such aperiodic stationary solutions, they
 tend to have the appearance of front-to-back waves (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\bar{\chi}<0$
\end_inset

) at most points in time, with occasional localized flips in the sign of
 phase asymmetry (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: phase_ODE_gamma_nonzero"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

b).
 We note that the timing of the these sign flips are generally not well
 predicted by Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:phase_asymm_flip"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 which neglects interactions between the oscillators.
 Finally, such solutions spend roughly equal amounts of time with neighbours
 close in-phase as it does with them near anti-phase (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Non-entrained-Dynamics"

 exhibits neighbours in near anti-phase.

Dynamics of Entrainment

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 are chosen appropriately, the system approaches an entrained state with
 fixed period across the jaw (see red line in the upper part of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: phase_ODE_period_gradients"
plural "false"

\end_inset

a).
 In this case, if initial conditions are chosen appropriately, it is possible
 to maintain front-to-back waves indefinitely, but not an observed gradient
 in period.
 On the other hand, choosing initial conditions corresponding to back-to-front
 waves, we observed a rapid breakdown in wave directionality starting at
 the midjaw and spreading outwards.
 For example, we can obtain such initial conditions by integrating backwards
 in time with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0$
\end_inset

 starting from a perfect anti-phase state (i.e., similar to the solution presented
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: phase_row_uncoupled"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

a), and then integrating fowards in time with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1$
\end_inset

, we see an immediate switch in phase asymmetry adjacent to the middle oscillato
r while the phase asymmetry of the oscillators at the rear of the jaw only
 swicthes sign after about four replacement cycles (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:supp_fig_coupled_ODE"

e).
 Thus, this model of nearest-neighbour interactions with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma>0$
\end_inset

 is generally incapable of producing sustained back-to-front replacement
 waves as observed in leopard geckos (and many other species) as well as
 the rapid switching in replacement waves directionality observed in crocodiles.

\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$

.
 In the latter PDE model, the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 play precisely the same roles as before; what is more, the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 additionally allow us to control (i) the timescale of reaction-diffusion
 dynamics relative to the phase dynamics and (ii) the space scale of inhibitory
 coupling, respectively.
 In the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\to0$
\end_inset

, we recover the instantaneous inter-oscillator communication as was assumed
 in the nearest-neighbour model, while for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\gg0$
\end_inset

 there is some delay between when an inhibitory molecule is secreted at
 one tooth site and it arriving at its neighbour(s).
 Meanwhile, as we increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 the spatial decay of inhibitory signal emanating the toothsites is reduced,
 and in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa\to\infty$
\end_inset

 all teeth inhibit one another with equal magnitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Effects of non-local coupling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin once again with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0$
\end_inset

 and work in the adiabatic limit (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\to0$
\end_inset

), allowing for variations in the model parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

.
 Intriguingly, with the inclusion of non-local coupling, even with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0$
\end_inset

, we can find entrained states exhibiting front-to-back replacement waves
 for all values 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 tested.
 We note that these waves become increasingly subtle as we decrease either
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 (see upper inset in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

a).
 Similar to the ODE model, these waves have bilateral symmetry for small
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 , and bifurcate through a supercritical pitchfork of periodics into a pair
 of left and right shifted front-to-back waves for sufficiently large 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 moves shifts the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

center
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the shifted waves further from the midjaw, such that they may eventually
 become unidirectional waves for large

 (see upper inset in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

a).
 All these families of periodic solutions terminate in heteroclinic bifurcations
, with larger values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 resulting in solutions that converge to simple equilibria (see HT labels
 in Fig.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For sufficiently large 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa\apprge1.45$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=11$
\end_inset

) and small 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, we also observe the emergence of a novel solution type with bilateral
 symmetry, termed boundary waves, where two teeth at the rear of the jaw
 (i.e., near the domain boundaries) have phase asymmeries that would typically
 be associated with back-to-front waves while the rest of the jaw exhibits
 front-to-back waves.
 Using continuation methods we find that this family of solutions is connected
 to the family of front-to-back waves through two saddle-node of periodics
 bifurcations, one of which causes its annihilation at a non-zero value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 By increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

, we see that the position of the saddle-nodes shifts to larger 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 growing the parameter region where the boundary waves exist.

We next continue the two bilaterally symmetric solutions obtained in the

 Interestingly, both the front-to-back waves and the boundary waves are
 gradually tranformed into back-to-front wave as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 increases.
 For both types of waves this occurs through a decrease in the slope of
 the apparent front-to-back waves (i.e., the waves at the center of the domain
 for the boundary waves) until they are transformed into anti-phase replacement,
 and then any subsequent increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 results in apparent back-to-front waves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

, the slope of the back-to-front waves is roughly constant throughout the
 domain.
 On the other hand, for large values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 the slope of these waves is very shallow at midjaw and becomes much steeper
 near the rear of the jaw.

Dynamics of Phase Asymmetry 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the absence of any coupling between oscillators, it is possible to compute
 the precise times when phase asymmetry will change sign as well as the
 phase asymmetry the develops from a specific initial condition.
 In order to do so, we consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{{\rm th}}$
\end_inset

 oscillator which has a period 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{n}$
\end_inset

, and the normalized phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{n}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{flalign*}
\phi_{n} & =\frac{t}{T_{n}}+\delta_{n}
\end{flalign*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{n}\in\left[0,1\right)$
\end_inset

 is the initial normalised phase difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spontaneous Development of Phase Asymmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to predict the phase asymmetry that intially emerges from a given
 initial condtion, we define the next and previous eruption times, given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\tau_{n}^{{\rm next}} & =\text{mod}\left(1-\phi_{n},1\right)T_{n}+t\\
\shortintertext{and}\tau_{n}^{{\rm prev}} & =\tau_{n}^{{\rm next}}-T_{n},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

respectively.
 The left and right relative phases are then given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\phi_{r}^{n} & =\frac{\tau_{n}^{{\rm next}}-\left.\tau_{n+1}^{{\rm prev}}\right|_{t=\tau_{n}^{next}}}{T_{n+1}}\\
\shortintertext{and}\phi_{l}^{n} & =\frac{\tau_{n}^{{\rm next}}-\left.\tau_{n-1}^{{\rm prev}}\right|_{t=\tau_{n}^{next}}}{T_{n-1}},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

respectively.
 Finally, in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $t\to0^{+}$
\end_inset

 we find that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi_{r}^{n}-\phi_{l}^{n}=\text{mod}\left(\delta_{l}^{n}-\frac{\text{sgn}\left(n-\frac{1}{2}\right)}{|n-1|+N_{0}/\gamma},1\right)-\text{mod}\left(\frac{\text{sgn}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)}{|n+1|+N_{0}/\gamma}-\delta_{r}^{n},1\right),\label{eq:intial_phase_asymm}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{mod}$
\end_inset

 is the modulo function, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{r}^{n}=\delta_{n}-\delta_{n+1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{l}^{n}=\delta_{n}-\delta_{n-1}$
\end_inset

.
 We can further simplify this result using the physiologically-reasonable
 assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\gamma<N_{0}/2$
\end_inset

, such that for anti-phase initial conditions (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{l}^{n}=\delta_{r}^{n}=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

) we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi_{r}^{n}-\phi_{l}^{n}=-\text{sgn}\left(n\right)\left(\frac{1}{|n-1|+N_{0}/\gamma}+\frac{1}{|n+1|+N_{0}/\gamma}\right),\label{eq:initial_phase_asymm_anti}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

while for in-phase initial conditions (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{l}^{n}=\delta_{r}^{n}=0$
\end_inset

) we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi_{r}^{n}-\phi_{l}^{n}=\text{sgn}\left(n\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{|n-1|+N_{0}/\gamma}-\frac{1}{|n+1|+N_{0}/\gamma}\right).\label{eq:initial_phase_asymm_inphase}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 As illustated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Initial-phase-asymmetry"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, this predicts positive phase asymmetry on the left side of the jaw and
 negative asymmetry on the left (i.e., apparent front-to-back replacement
 waves) for anti-phase initial conditions, while for in-phase intial conditions
 we find the opposite (i.e., apparent back-to-front replacement waves).

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{sgn}(x)$
\end_inset

 denotes the signum function.
 Notably, all three conditions predict that the sign flipping time increases
 with the second power of 
\begin_inset Formula $|n|$
\end_inset

, and the first condition produces sign flipping approximately twice as
 frequently as the other two.
 With the simplifying assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{l}^{n}-\delta_{r}^{n}$
\end_inset

 is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 we generically observed sign flipping that spreads from the middle of the
 jaw outwards; this behaviour can be described by (i) the time of the first
 flipping at 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\pm1$
\end_inset

, given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{1}=T_{0}\left(k+\text{sgn}(n)\left(\delta_{n+1}-\delta_{n-1}\right)\right)\left(1+N_{0}/(2\gamma)\right)
\]

\end_inset

and (ii) the propagation time estimate (i.e., the difference between the flipping
 time at 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\pm N_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\pm1$
\end_inset

, respectively), given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta=T_{0}\left(k+\text{sgn}(n)\left(\delta_{n+1}-\delta_{n-1}\right)\right)\left(1+\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)\left(N_{0}-1\right)
\]

\end_inset

where we have made the mild assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{0}\gg\gamma$
\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both in-phase and anti-phase initial conditions have 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{n+1}=\delta_{n-1}$
\end_inset

and thus both the flipping time and propagation time are determined entirely
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 For these intial conditions, with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

 we observe sign flipping simultaneously throughout the jaw at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, similar to what is described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Edmund1962"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In contrast, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 and gecko (crocodile) jaw parameters we find a first flipping time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}=226T_{0}$
\end_inset

( 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}=11.5T_{0}$
\end_inset

) and a propagation time 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=47.25T_{0}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=31.5T_{0}$
\end_inset

).
 If we assume fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 month (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}=9$
\end_inset

 months) for geckos (crocodiles) then we predict a first flipping time of
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}\approx18.8$
\end_inset

 years (
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}\approx8.625$
\end_inset

 years) and a propagation time of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\approx3.85$
\end_inset

 years (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\approx22.5$
\end_inset

 years).
 We note that it is possible to relax the fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}$
\end_inset

 to account for aging effects, and that for reasonable assumptions this
 changes all sign flipping timing predictions by less that 10% [data not
 shown].

 In such a setting, the spatial profile of inhibitor concentration can be

 we can directly compute the inhibitor concentration as

 nearly all intial conditions converge to spatially patterned oscillations

 Increasing

 causes the simple back-to-front waves to break down into a many small wavelets
 that propagate leftwards and rightwards until they collide and appear to
 annihilate (see Fig.

\begin_layout Standard
As 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 increases, the left-right symmetry of front-to-back waves breaks down.
 This results in an entrained state where the waves seem to emanate from
 a point that is shifted away from the middle oscillator.
 The

 of these waves can be shifted both left or right, and preliminary evidence
 suggests that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 increases the size of the shift.

Phase Asymmtery and the Anti-Phase Metric Dynamics

\begin_layout Standard
Phase differences between any pair of oscillators are fixed in any entrained
 state.
 Accordingly, entrained states exhibit a constant value of the anti-phase
 metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{n}$

 for each oscillator 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 The ODE model Eq.

 posseses periodic solutions (entrained states) exhibting apparent front-to-back
 waves for

 values (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 More specificically, with the choice
